            <p class="pg">Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest
                social media following in the world among sports teams.[9][10] Barcelona players have won a record
                twelve Ballon d'Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record seven FIFA World
                Player of the Year awards, with winners including Romário, Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. In 2010,
                three players who came through the club's youth academy (Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi) were
                chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat for
                players from the same football academy. Additionally, players representing the club have won a record
                eight European Golden Shoe awards.</p>
